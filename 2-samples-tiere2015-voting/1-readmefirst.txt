I programmed the "tiere2015"-voting system completely alone within (round about)
5 months with my FORMER autodidactic knowledge of PHP.

It was intended to be combined with a charity event: Please open the index.html in a browser of your choice.
Originally, it is a php file - I just renamed it to a html file for you for better reading - if your German is at least,
I would say, B2.

It also was intended for the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals in Klosterneuburg. The reason for working on it,
were other priorities in my life. But I'll continue/reprogram it (in OBJ.O.-PHP).
